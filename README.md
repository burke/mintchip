# Mintchip

Mintchip is a gem wrapping as much mintchip-related functionality
as possible.

It includes a wrapper for the hosted API (`Mintchip::Hosted`), and
a generator for ValueRequestMessages.

The API is in flux and I haven't had a chance to write docs, so 
browse the source for details. It's fairly friendly code.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'mintchip'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mintchip
